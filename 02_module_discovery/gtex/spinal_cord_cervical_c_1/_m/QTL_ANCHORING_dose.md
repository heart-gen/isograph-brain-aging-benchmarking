# Genetic anchoring — isograph co-switch modules vs GTEx Brain_Spinal_cord_cervical_c-1 xQTL (gtex-aging/spinal_cord_cervical_c_1)

Dose sensitivity (Poisson: number of independent SuSiE credible sets ~ module membership + covariates). Distinguishes a gene with one weak cis signal from one with several independent ones; LD-resolved.

Covariates: log cis-variant count, log gene length, log isoform count [+ log intron group size for sQTL].

Reproduce: `python -m isograph_benchmark.real_data.qtl_anchoring --analysis gtex-aging --region spinal_cord_cervical_c_1`

## Reading

- **Read the two arms together, not the ratio alone.** Co-switch module genes are cis-QTL *depleted* for BOTH modalities (OR < 1 in every tissue tested); the result is that splicing-QTL is spared RELATIVE to expression-QTL, i.e. sQTL OR / eQTL OR > 1. It is a ratio of two depletions, not an enrichment, and must never be described as sQTL enrichment.
- Matching on cis-variant count / gene length / isoform multiplicity controls the dominant QTL-detectability confound; `rate_fg` vs `rate_bg` is the raw (unmatched) contrast for reference.
- Scope: cis-sQTL enrichment shows module *members* undergo genetically regulated splicing; it does not by itself prove the *co-switching* is genetic (a shared trans regulator / cell composition could coordinate it).
